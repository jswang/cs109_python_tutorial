**Go to this jupyter notebook to read through the tutorial! https://github.com/sjohnsonyu/cs109_python_tutorial/blob/master/cs109_python_tutorial.ipynb**

Occasionally GitHub has trouble rendering jupyter notebooks in static HTML. If it's not loading, you can use this link instead:

Alternatively, if you've already installed python and pip, you can:
- Install Jupyter by running this command in your terminal:  `python3 -m pip install jupyter`
- Download the jupyter notebook file (extension .ipynb) 
- Open up your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the jupyter notebook
- Run the command `jupyter notebook`. This should open up a new tab in your browser, where you can click on the name of the notebook file to open and explore.
